# Welcome! üëã How's it going?

## Who am I? üë®‚Äçüíª

I was introduced to the world of technology when my parents bought the first computer in the house. Fun fact: I learned to type on a keyboard before I could write by hand.

I knew I wanted to have a career in this industry, so after I graduated from high school, I did all things related to computers or technology in general. First, I worked as a helper in my brother's business, repairing printers, while in high school. Then, my father, who works as an electrician, hired me to work alongside him.

I am a businessman and entrepreneur at heart. My first venture was a barbershop that I ran from my house. I also used to sell electronic devices such as portable speakers, SD memory cards, etc. A friend of mine told me about web development, and after watching some tutorials on YouTube, I immediately chose to pursue a career in this field.

## What can I do?

Develop websites using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I also use React and Redux for the user or frontend side of a web application and Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL for the backend.

Don't hesitate to reach out to me! I'm looking for job opportunities. üòâ

## Projects and Contributions

I've built two projects and had one contribution so far! To keep it short, I'll go over each one:

1. Rick and Morty: This web application features a search bar to search characters brought from an API, and you can also add them to a "My Favorites" list.

2. Cooking Recipes Library: This project also features a search bar to search for cooking recipes. Clicking on a recipe will display its name, summary, and a step-by-step guide on how to make it. You can create your own recipes, too!

3. ElectroShop: This is my only contribution so far! I worked alongside other talented developers to deliver an e-commerce store in just under four weeks. I designed and developed an "About Us" section and an admin dashboard to create products and manage users.
